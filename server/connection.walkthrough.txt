1. Install packages: TS, Node, Express, Dotenv-safe
1b. Install dev package types for node and express
1c. NPX tsconfig.json to get tsconfig file
2. create environment variable for port
3. In index.ts file import express and dotenv-safe/config
4. Set up scripts to watch ts file and nodemon index.js file in dist
NODE AND EXPRESS CONNECTION DONE

5. In root folder (same folder that holds package.json) create "ormconfig.json" file
6. Configure for database type, host (most likely localhost), username of db, password of db, synchronize (for auto migration and table update) and **OPTIONAL** logging-- to log the SQL
7. create a connection between typeorm and db with createConnection function provided by TypeOrm
8. encase  

const main = async () => {
  const connection = await createConnection({
    type: "postgres",
    url: "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/pern",
    logging: true,
    synchronize: true,
    entities: [Post],
  });

  const app = express();

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
  });
}

  in a main async function to make it easier

9. call the main function at the bottom of the file outside main function

10. create entities folder and create entity for database
11. include entity in ormconfig file
12. run development environment

pg_ctlcluster 12 main start-- to start the cluster
